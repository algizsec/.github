## **`ᛉ`** About us  
Independent smart contract security team focused on helping protocols launch with confidence by delivering audits with depth, precision, and speed.

We believe that trust is the foundation of Web3 - and trust is impossible without security.
Without security, users will not deposit capital, and protocols cannot gain traction, grow, or scale.

Our mission is simple:  
**Build the trust layer that Web3 needs to scale.**


## **`ᚱ`** Our story  
Fascinated by blockchain technology, we saw the immense value and potential it brings.  
As we went deeper into the industry, we also saw another reality: brilliant ideas held back by critical vulnerabilities, flawed assumptions, and devastating exploits that wiped out user funds and ended promising protocols.

Coming from product, engineering, and systems backgrounds, we recognized a core truth:

Security is the single biggest factor preventing mass adoption.  
Users will not trust protocols with their assets unless the underlying logic is sound - every edge case, every invariant, every assumption.

We founded Algiz to help solve this problem.

Our goal is clear:  
**Become the trusted security partner behind the protocols that will drive Web3’s next wave of growth.**
