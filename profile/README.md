## **`ᛉ`** About us  
Security partner for early-stage protocols.

We audit smart contracts for teams that need thorough security without enterprise timelines or big-firm bureaucracy. Founders who take security seriously but aren't ready for $50k audits and weeks-long queues.

We built Algiz because smaller teams deserve the same focused attention as large, well-established protocols.

Our mission is simple:  
**Make security accessible to every serious builder.**

With us you get:
- Quote in 24h, start same week
- Direct access to security experts reviewing your code
- Manual review of every line, every path

Security shouldn't be a luxury reserved for well-funded protocols.  
A critical vulnerability doesn't care how much you raised.

## **`ᚱ`** Our story  
We came from engineering and product - years building systems, shipping products, and learning what breaks under pressure.

We've also been on the other side. Personally invested in protocols during the ICO era, we watched promising projects get wrecked by exploits that a proper review would have caught. Not poor ideas - poor security.

We decided we couldn't stand by and watch. We could actually help. 
In parallel to private audits, we compete on Sherlock and Immunefi to sharpen our skills against real vulnerabilities. 25+ critical, high, and medium findings across diverse codebases.

Our goal is to **become the trusted security partner behind the next wave of protocols**.
